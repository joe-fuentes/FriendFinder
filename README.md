# FriendFinder

Compatibility should be determined based on the following.

Each user's results should be converted into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
You will then compare the difference between the user's scores against other users' scores, question by question. You will then add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.
Example:
User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
Remember to use the absolute value of the differences (i.e 5-3 and 3-5 should both be 2).
The person with the closest match should be the one with the "least" amount of difference.

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
